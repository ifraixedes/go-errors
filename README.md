# Go Errors

This package provides a way to handle Go errors through error codes with a simple API and without using specific exported error types, hence without casting.

__NOTE__ it's work in progress and at the time that it's ready for being used this README will be updated with more information about the package.

The import path of this package is `go.fraixed.es/errors`.
